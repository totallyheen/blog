# 1.0 Overview

With the Federal Reserve once again cutting interest rates to zero and embarking on massive quantitative easing measures in response to the economic malaise brought about by COVID-19, retail investors are becoming increasingly aware that leaving their hard-earned money in the bank is financially imprudent. 

However, it may seem daunting for first-time investors looking to enter the market, with so many finance websites offering different resources and opinions. Our application looks to guide the beginner investor in their journey to begin investing by zeroing in on a select few stocks, commodities and bonds. 


# 2.0 Motivation and Objectives

Existing financial data websites such as Yahoo Finance do a good job in providing historical price data and technical indicators, but the beginner investor lacks the knowledge to properly utilise and benefit from these. For example, there is a whole plethora of technical indicators available for use, but whether the investor is able to truly understand and use them properly is questionable. We have also identified a gap in such websites, that they do not provide any form of forecasting or cross-asset analysis to aid in investors’ decisions. In addition, it may be informative for an investor to see how macro events on a global scale may affect assets.

This project aims to utilise various R packages, mainly tidyverse, TTR and dtwcluster in building an interactive R Shiny application. The R Shiny application (details in section 2) will be an integrated dashboard which allows users to perform different types of analysis while aiding them in making informed decisions in portfolio construction.

# 3.0 Scope

# 5.0 Application Features

The main target audience for our application are prospective investors who are looking for a tool to help them build their portfolio and diversify their holdings. This section explores features of our application and some ways it can help our users. The application itself is split up into 3 main sections address different parts of the investing process.


## 5.1 Exploratory Data Analysis
**Key visualizations and analysis of key financial asset returns metrics**


  - Diversification through identifying weakly correlated markets and indices. This allows the user to *‘put their eggs across different baskets’* and spread out their risk
  - Forecast what are the likely price movements in the period ahead in order to identify optimal entry points
  - Time series clustering to identify markets that go through similar cyclical movements across different time periods. This will help the user identify potential entry and exit points from the market. 
  
  
  
On top of displaying historical price trends, our dashboard will include visualizations of Time Series Forecasting, Clustering as well as selected technical indicators for a list of financial assets which is discussed in section 4. These are subject to user preferences in an ‘add/ remove’ manner.

  - Visualization of time series data of various financial indices
  - Correlation analysis across all financial indices
  - Time series forecasting on index prices for the near future
  - Cluster analysis on selected financial indices
  - Targeted technical analysis on selected financial assets
  - Callout of various macro events
  

### 5.1.1 Exploratory Data Analysis 

### 5.1.2 Overlay of key events


## 5.2 Time-Series Forecasting
**Predicting financial asset prices using an ARIMA model**

ARIMA is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a class of model that captures a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data.

  - AR: Autoregression. A regression model that uses the dependencies between an observation and a number of lagged observations.

  - I: Integrated. To make the time series stationary by measuring the differences of observations at different time.

  - MA: Moving Average. An approach that takes into accounts the dependency between observations and the residual error terms when a moving average model is     used to the lagged observations (q).

Along with various parameters to be tuned, an ARIMA model uses purely price action data for forecasting future prices.

The general form of an ARIMA model is denoted as ARIMA (p, q, d). With seasonal time series data, it is likely that short-run non-seasonal components contribute to the model. ARIMA model is typically represented as ARIMA (p, q, d), where: —

  - p is the number of lag observations utilized in training the model (i.e., lag order).
  - d is the number of times differencing is applied (i.e. the degree of differencing).
  - q is known as the size of the moving average window (i.e., order of moving average).

***Possible insights:*** *Forecast what are the likely price movements in the period ahead in order to identify optimal entry points*


## 5.3 Time-Series Clustering
**Clustering financial assets based on historical returns**

Time series clustering is to partition time series data into groups based on similarity or distance, so that time series in the same cluster are similar. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used as the similarity/distance metric and finds optimal alignment between two time series.

1. The first step is to work out an appropriate distance/similarity metric (i.e. DTW).

2. The second step, use existing clustering techniques, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering or subspace clustering, to find clustering structures.

3. The final result will then be presented on the visualization.

***Possible insights:*** *Time series in the same cluster are likely to undergo similar cycles and risks, which means that users will be exposed to higher risks if he/she is heavily invested in one cluster.*
