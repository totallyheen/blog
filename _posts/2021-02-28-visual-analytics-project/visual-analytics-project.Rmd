# 1.0 Overview

With the Federal Reserve once again cutting interest rates to zero and embarking on massive quantitative easing measures in response to the economic malaise brought about by COVID-19, retail investors are becoming increasingly aware that leaving their hard-earned money in the bank is financially imprudent. 

However, it may seem daunting for first-time investors looking to enter the market, with so many finance websites offering different resources and opinions. Our application looks to guide the beginner investor in their journey to begin investing by zeroing in on a select few stocks, commodities and bonds. 


# 2.0 Motivation and Objectives

Existing financial data websites such as Yahoo Finance do a good job in providing historical price data and technical indicators, but the beginner investor lacks the knowledge to properly utilise and benefit from these. For example, there is a whole plethora of technical indicators available for use, but whether the investor is able to truly understand and use them properly is questionable. We have also identified a gap in such websites, that they do not provide any form of forecasting or cross-asset analysis to aid in investors’ decisions. In addition, it may be informative for an investor to see how macro events on a global scale may affect assets.

This project aims to utilise various R packages, mainly tidyverse, TTR and dtwcluster in building an interactive R Shiny application. The R Shiny application (details in section 2) will be an integrated dashboard which allows users to perform different types of analysis while aiding them in making informed decisions in portfolio construction.

# 3.0 The Use-Case

The main target audience for our application are prospective investors who are looking for a tool to help them build their portfolio and diversify their holdings. These are a few ways that our application can help them:

  - Diversification through identifying weakly correlated markets and indices. This allows the user to *‘put their eggs     across different baskets’* and spread out their risk
  - Forecast what are the likely price movements in the period ahead in order to identify optimal entry points
  - Time series clustering to identify markets that go through similar cyclical movements across different time periods. This will help the user identify potential entry and exit points from the market. 

# 4.0 Application Features

On top of displaying historical price trends, our dashboard will include visualizations of Time Series Forecasting, Clustering as well as selected technical indicators for a list of financial assets which is discussed in section 4. These are subject to user preferences in an ‘add/ remove’ manner.

  - Visualization of time series data of various financial indices
  - Correlation analysis across all financial indices
  - Time series forecasting on index prices for the near future
  - Cluster analysis on selected financial indices
  - Targeted technical analysis on selected financial assets
  - Callout of various macro events
