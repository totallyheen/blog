### 1.1 Clarity

| S/N |        Comments                         |   Suggested Improvements                |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|C1|Points are plotted all across the map and it can hard to get a sense of severity or the number of incidents in each area. | Scale the points by size (e.g. Number of casualties) and make them transparent so underlying points can be seen. (Proportion Symbol Map). |
|C2|The line-plots all have different vertical scales which can make it hard to compare event counts across different categories. | Explore plotting them all on one graph on the same axis with color coding. This allows users to compare the counts across different event types as well. Doing this will free up space to add another chart. Fatalities by event type, but converted to a logarithmic scale|
|C3|Horizontal axis labeled as 'Event Date' but events are plotted on a 'Year' axis.| Change axis label to 'Event Year'|
|C4|The vertical axis label *'Count of Sheet1'* does not convey any meaningful message| Replace the label with *'Event Count'*|


### 1.2 Aesthetics

| S/N |        Comments                         |   Suggested Improvements                |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|A1|No vertical gridlines on line plots. This makes it hard to read the plots when they all share the horizontal axis at the bottom. |Include vertical gridlines to allow users to clearly identify the year in which the points are plotted|
|A2|Points are only colour coded and hard to tell apart when overlapping and scrunched together. | Points should also be scaled by size and translucent so that overlapping points are not lost |
|A3|Colours on the legend are not consistent throughout the dashboard.| For consistency sake, the line plots should have the same colour as the points on the map.|


### 1.3 Interactivity

| S/N |        Comments                         |   Suggested Improvements                |
|-----|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|I1|The map visualization is re-centered whenever the dashboard is filtered by another country. This allows the user to quickly focus on events and locations in said country. However, it can be hard to identify events that spill-over from neighbouring countries or along borders.| Change filter to allow multiple selections. Continue using the function where map re-centers around the filtered area. |
|I2|There are a lot of data points that are unused from the dataset that can be plotted on the map such as *'sub-event type'* or *'actors'*| Create a tooltip to incorporate these data points.|
|I3|There is no way to filter by *'Event date'*   this could be important information to see if events on the map are changing over time. | Add in filtering by *'event date'*|


# 2 - The suggested visualization

The proposed design is as follows.

# 3 - The Visualization process

*The Data Source used is from the The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). The data can be found [here](https://acleddata.com/#/dashboard).*

### 3.1 Steps taken for first visualization (Map)

1. Download data file with an .xlsx file format.

2. Load file into Tableau Desktop

3. Check and ensure that data-types for geographical information are correctly identified. 


```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=50, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Ensuring Lat/Long attributes have geographical roles)"}
knitr::include_graphics("step1.png")
```

4. Drag the *longitude* and *latitude* fields on to the column and row shelves respectively. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Creating the map"}
knitr::include_graphics("step2.png")
```

5. Drag *Event Type* and *Event Id Cnty* to the Marks card.

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Plotting the points"}
knitr::include_graphics("step3.png")
```

6. Drag *Fatalities* to the size and make the measure a *SUM*. Increase the size of the marks

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Scaling the size of points by fatalities"}
knitr::include_graphics("step4.png")
```


7. Change the range of the size legend from *0 - 243* to *0 - 250* to have consistent ranges.

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Creating a consistent legend"}
knitr::include_graphics("step5.png")
```

8. Rename the title of the size legend from *SUM(Fatalities)* to *Number of Fatalities*

9. Decrease the opacity of the circles in the colour menu from 100% to 50% to allow overlapping points to show. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=50, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Making the circles partially transparent"}
knitr::include_graphics("step6.png")
```

10. Drag the *Event Date* on to the filter pane. Select *Years* as filter method and select all for filtering. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=50, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Creating a Year filter for events"}
knitr::include_graphics("step7.png")
```

11. Drag *Country* on to the filter pane. Select all countries for filtering. 

12. Drag *Event Type* on to the filter pane. Select all types for filtering. 

13. Drag *Sub Event Type* on to the filter pane. Select all types for filtering. 

14. Drag *Admin1* on to the filter pane. Select all types for filtering. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Adding all the other filters"}
knitr::include_graphics("step8.png")
```

15. Show the *Country*, *Admin1*, *Event Type* and *Sub Event Type* filters . Change filter type to *Multiple Values (Dropdown)* in order to better manage space in the dashboard.

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Showing and decluttering the filters created"}
knitr::include_graphics("step9.png")
```

16. For *Admin1*, change the display criteria to *'Only Relevant Values'*. This will make it only show data points relevant to the selection of other filters. e.g. only show *Admin1* values relevant to *Cambodia* when *country* is filtered by *Cambodia*.

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Adding the State filter and only showing values to selected country"}
knitr::include_graphics("step10.png")
```


17. Rename the filter *Admin1* to *State*

18. Show the *YEAR (Event Date)* filter. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=60, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Exposing filters to users"}
knitr::include_graphics("step11.png")
```

19. Include *Sub Event Type, Actor 1, Assoc Actor 1, Actor 2, Assoc Actor 2, Event Date, Country, Admin1* into the tooltips

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=60, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Adding more information into tooltips"}
knitr::include_graphics("step12.png")
```

20. Reformat the tooltip into three distinct parts 'Event Details', 'Event Location' and 'Involved Parties'

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Reformatting the tooltips"}
knitr::include_graphics("step13.png")
```

21. Rename the visualization to *Armed Conflict Location & Event in < Country>, <YEAR(Event Date)>*

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Renaming the visualization"}
knitr::include_graphics("step14.png")

30. Rename the horizontal axis as *Number of Events*

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, fig.width=60, fig.height=100, fig.cap="Renaming the axis"}
knitr::include_graphics("step19.png")
```

31. Add in sheet as tooltip in the original visualization. Tooltip will show breakdown of event counts by country for each given event type. 

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="How the tooltip and formatting looks like"}
knitr::include_graphics("step20.png")
```

32. Rename chart as *Event Count*

knitr::include_graphics("step26.png")
```

39. Rename chart as *Number of Fatalities*

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Renaming the chart"}

```

The interactive dashboard is uploaded onto Tableau Public Server and can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/ArmedConflictLocationandEventDashboard/Dashboard?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link).

# 5 - New Insights

## 5.1 Myanmar, Philipines and Thailand are the deadliest countries

```{r, fig.align="center",layout='l-page',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Location of the most deadly events"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight1.png")
```

As seen by the diagram, Myanmar, Philipines and Thailand are indicated by the blue arrows. These are areas in which there are the highest concentration of circles and more importantly - big circles. This means that events in these countries usually result in a huge loss of life. 

Comparatively, countries like Vietnam have relatively minor events compared to these countries. 

## 5.2 The single deadliest event happened in Myanmar

```{r, fig.align="center",layout='l-page',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The deadliest event"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight2.png")
```

The single deadliest event happened in the Rakhine state in on 28 August 2017. On that day 243 people died in a clash between the Myanmar military and the Rohingya muslims. The violence against the Rohingya muslims are well known and commonplace. In fact, almost all of the violence against civilian events in the Rakhine state were carried out against the Rohingya civilian muslims. 

## 5.3 Indonesia: Many protests but protests are barely fatal. 

```{r, fig.align="center",layout='l-page',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Indonesia's Events over the years and locations"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight3.png")
```

As can be seen in the event counts line graph: Protests are by far the most common events in Indonesia and the number of protests have grown considerably in the second half of the decade and even surpassing 1000 in 2020 (as seen by the orange arrows). Deaths associated with protest events however are always considerably rare. The deadliest year of protests only resulted in 5 deaths (2015). On good years, protests have resulted in zero deaths - including the peak year of 2020. 

From the map, we can also observe an intersting sign - Kalimantan has least events and fatalities (blue arrow). Compared to the rest of the states like Papua, Java, Aceh and Sulawesi (red arrows), Kalimantan rarely has armed conflicts (as seen by the relatively fewer number of circles) and even if there are events, they usually do not result in massive loss of lives (circles present in Kalimantan are small).

## 5.4 WMD are used only in a few countries

As identified in 5.1, Thailand, Mynamar and Philipines are the countries where most deaths occur. This could be partly due to the use of explosives/remote violence in these events. Looking at the sub-event types (called out in the dropdown list), these events usually involve weapons that can harm many people at once and can be termed as what we call weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

```{r, fig.align="center",layout='l-page',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="WMD events over the years and locations"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight4.png")
```

These events are usually conducted by 2 main actors. 

1. The state against civilians. The listed countries generally do not have any qualms against using military grade equipment such as air or artillery strikes against civilians. These usually results in huge loss of lives as civilians barely have any power to retaliate. 

2. Armed militia groups or terror groups. There are groups within these countries with access to sophisticated weaponry (think lax gun control laws). Such groups can range from Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines to the JAD in Indonesia to the Malay Muslim Separatist in the Thai border near Malaysia. 

## 5.5 Spike in 2016 deaths and events caused by data from Philipines 

```{r, fig.align="center",layout='l-page',echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Correlating numbers to Phillipines data"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight5.png")
```

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Phillipines spike in 2016"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight6.png")
```

Data from Phillipines was not made available until 2016. It was also that year where Philipines almost singlehandedly contributed to the entire death count caused by violence to civilians and battles. This could be attributed to President Duerte taking office in June 2016 and declaring a drug war. The violence to civilians could be collateral damage and battles could be with drug gangs resisting against the crackdown. 

This could mean that the number of events and fatalities before 2016 could be even higher had data from Philippines been made available. Following the addition of Phillipines to the dataset, deaths due to violence towards civilians and battles from Phillipines remained the highest until 2019 where the conflict between the Rohingya muslims and the Myanmar government intensified in the Rakhine state.

```{r, fig.align="center",echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Numerous deadly events in Rakhine in 2019"}
knitr::include_graphics("insight7.png")
```
