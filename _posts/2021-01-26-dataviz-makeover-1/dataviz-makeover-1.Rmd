  Suggesting ways for improving and reworking the original data visualisation. 
  
  Highlight what works and what doesn’t. Explain why those things don’t work, and how you can make it better. Use the fields in the data set provided and improve upon the original visualisations. However, if supplementing other data sources helps to tell a better story, go for it!

# 1 - Critique the visualization
Identify at least three from each evaluation criterion (Clarity and aesthetics)

![](C:/totallyheen/blog/_posts/2021-01-26-dataviz-makeover-1/Original_Viz.jpg)

## 1.1 Clarity 

### 1.1.1 Unclear title

The title “Resident Labour Force by Age” was used for the visualization. This is unclear and does not inform the reader quickly what the visualization is depicting which is the comparison of labour force by age groups between 2009 and 2019.

*Suggestion* - Change title

Use the title “Resident Labour Force by Age Groups, June 2009 vs June 2019”


### 1.1.2 Wrong visualization used for the given datatype

Age groups are a categorical datatype instead. The line graph being used currently is better suited for continuous datatypes

*Suggestion* - Change Visualization Type

1.	Switch to using a bar graph instead of a line graph. 
2.	Ensure Vertical Axis starts at zero

### 1.1.3 Plotting a median line on categorical scale

Data has already been binned into age groups. There is no way of calculating a discrete age for median like 41. If there is a median, it should be the age group of 40-44. i.e. Both groups will have the same median. 

*Suggestion* - Remove the median lines

Mark the bars for 40-44 with a label to show that the median falls within that category. 

### 1.1.4 Percentages can omit context

Using percentages like the Labour force participation rate can omit important contextual information like the true number of people in each age group.


*Suggestion* - Plot the bar graph with actual numbers instead of percentages

Bar graphs should be sufficient to show the differences in proportions across different categories

### 1.1.5 Unclear description of percentages points

When comparing percentages across different groups and time periods, the term to be used should be percentage points. While the write up does not use the words percentage change, it can be ambiguous.


*Suggestion* - Clarify the changes in percentages.

Points being made on changes in percentages such as “Declined from 75% to 67%” can be rewritten as “Declined 8 percentage points from 75% to 67%”.

### 1.1.6 Write up not aligned with visualization

The opening line of the write up refers to LFPR (Labour Force Participation Rate) whereas the visualization depicts the proportion of labour force. There is no data visualization to that readers can refer to while reading statements related to LFPR.



*Suggestion* - Include a second visualization on Labour Force Participation

With all the clarity and aesthetic suggestions included. Use Table 5 on labour force and Table 7 on participation rates to get numbers by age group for labour force participation. Together, the two graphs will give a clearer idea of how much labour force participation there is with respect to the resident labour force size.


## 1.2 Aesthetics

### 1.2.1 Missing vertical axis and gridlines

Vertical axis is missing, and gridlines are not present on the vertical axis. This can make comparison across different age groups difficult. The units for the vertical axis “Per Cent” is put under the title as well. 

*Suggestion* - Add in missing elements

1.	Vertical axis should be added to the visualization
2.	Gridlines and tick marks on the vertical axis should be added
3.	Label Vertical axis title as “Resident Labour Force (‘000s)”

### 1.2.2 Good use of Colours

Good consistent (e.g. lines, labels, data table) use of colours to differentiate between 2009 and 2019. 


*Suggestion* - Follow and recreate a similar aesthetic. 

Ensure colours and format are replicated across both graphs.

### 1.2.3 Good use of space and no need for legend

Following on from point S2, the colours have already well marked out the datapoints and features relating to 2009 and 2019. It would be superfluous to add in a legend. 

*Suggestion* - Follow and recreate a similar aesthetic. 

Ensure colours and format are replicated across both graphs.

### 1.2.4 Missing horizontal axis label

Horizontal axis label is missing. Although it can be inferred based on the categories and the title of the visualization. It would be better if the axis is clearly labelled.

*Suggestion* - Add in missing elements

1.	Label horizontal axis title as “Age Groups”
2.	Gridlines and tick marks will not be needed as visualization will be changed to a bar graph.

# 2 - A sketch of the improved visualization
With reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design tries to overcome. 

# 3 - The improved data visualization 
Using Tableau, design the proposed data visualization. 

# 4 - The data preparation process
Provide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared. 

## 4.1 Data Sources Used:

1. [RESIDENT  LABOUR  FORCE  PARTICIPATION  RATE  BY  AGE  AND  SEX,  2009 - 2019 (JUNE) - TABLE 5](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx)
2. [RESIDENT  LABOUR  FORCE  AGED  FIFTEEN  YEARS  AND  OVER  BY  AGE  AND  SEX,  2009 - 2019  (JUNE) - Table 7](https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx)
