(Proportion Symbol Map).\r\nC2\r\nThe line-plots all have different vertical scales which can make it hard to compare event counts across different categories.\r\nExplore plotting them all on one graph on the same axis with color coding. This allows users to compare the counts across different event types as well. Doing this will free up space to add another chart. Fatalities by event type, but converted to a logarithmic scale\r\nC3\r\nHorizontal axis labeled as ‘Event Date’ but events are plotted on a ‘Year’ axis.\r\nChange axis label to ‘Event Year’\r\nC4\r\nThe vertical axis label ‘Count of Sheet1’ does not convey any meaningful message\r\nReplace the label with ‘Event Count’\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\nA1\r\nNo vertical gridlines on line plots. This makes it hard to read the plots when they all share the horizontal axis at the bottom.\r\nInclude vertical gridlines to allow users to clearly identify the year in which the points are plotted\r\nA2\r\nPoints are only colour coded and hard to tell apart when overlapping and scrunched together.\r\nPoints should also be scaled by size and translucent so that overlapping points are not lost\r\nA3\r\nColours on the legend are not consistent throughout the dashboard.\r\nFor consistency sake, the line plots should have the same colour as the points on the map.\r\n1.3 Interactivity\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\nI1\r\nThe map visualization is re-centered whenever the dashboard is filtered by another country. This allows the user to quickly focus on events and locations in said country. However, it can be hard to identify events that spill-over from neighbouring countries or along borders.\r\nChange filter to allow multiple selections. Continue using the function where map re-centers around the filtered area.\r\nI2\r\nThere are a lot of data points that are unused from the dataset that can be plotted on the map such as ‘sub-event type’ or ‘actors’\r\nCreate a tooltip to incorporate these data points.\r\nI3\r\nThere is no way to filter by ‘Event date’ this could be important information to see if events on the map are changing over time.\r\nAdd in filtering by ‘event date’\r\n2 - The suggested visualization\r\nThe proposed design is as follows.\r\n3 - The Visualization process\r\nThe Data Source used is from the The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED). The data can be found here.\r\n3.1 Steps taken for first visualization (Map)\r\nDownload data file with an .xlsx file format.\r\nLoad file into Tableau Desktop\r\nCheck and ensure that data-types for geographical information are correctly identified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Ensuring Lat/Long attributes have geographical roles)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag the longitude and latitude fields on to the column and row shelves respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Creating the map\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag Event Type and Event Id Cnty to the Marks card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Plotting the points\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrag Fatalities to the size and make the measure a SUM.

These are areas in which there are the highest concentration of circles and more importantly - big circles. This means that events in these countries usually result in a huge loss of life.\r\nComparatively, countries like Vietnam have relatively minor events compared to these countries.\r\n5.2 The single deadliest event happened in Myanmar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 43: The deadliest event\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe single deadliest event happened in the Rakhine state in on 28 August 2017. On that day 243 people died in a clash between the Myanmar military and the Rohingya muslims. The violence against the Rohingya muslims are well known and commonplace. In fact, almost all of the violence against civilian events in the Rakhine state were carried out against the Rohingya civilian muslims.\r\n5.3 Indonesia: Many protests but protests are barely fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 44: Indonesia’s Events over the years and locations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the event counts line graph: Protests are by far the most common events in Indonesia and the number of protests have grown considerably in the second half of the decade and even surpassing 1000 in 2020 (as seen by the orange arrows). Deaths associated with protest events however are always considerably rare. The deadliest year of protests only resulted in 5 deaths (2015). On good years, protests have resulted in zero deaths - including the peak year of 2020.\r\nFrom the map, we can also observe an intersting sign - Kalimantan has least events and fatalities (blue arrow). Compared to the rest of the states like Papua, Java, Aceh and Sulawesi (red arrows), Kalimantan rarely has armed conflicts (as seen by the relatively fewer number of circles) and even if there are events, they usually do not result in massive loss of lives (circles present in Kalimantan are small).\r\n5.4 WMD are used only in a few countries\r\nAs identified in 5.1, Thailand, Mynamar and Philipines are the countries where most deaths occur. This could be partly due to the use of explosives/remote violence in these events. Looking at the sub-event types (called out in the dropdown list), these events usually involve weapons that can harm many people at once and can be termed as what we call weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 45: Indonesia’s Events over the years and locations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese events are usually conducted by 2 main actors.\r\nThe state against civilians. The listed countries generally do not have any qualms against using military grade equipment such as air or artillery strikes against civilians. These usually results in huge loss of lives as civilians barely have any power to retaliate.\r\nArmed militia groups or terror groups. There are groups within these countries with access to sophisticated weaponry (think lax gun control laws). Such groups can range from Abu Sayyaf in the Philippines to the JAD in Indonesia to the Malay Muslim Separatist in the Thai border near Malaysia.\r\n5.5 Spike in 2016 deaths and events caused by data from Philipines\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 46: Indonesia’s Events over the years and locations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 47: Indonesia’s Events over the years and locations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData from Phillipines was not made available until 2016. It was also that year where Philipines almost singlehandedly contributed to the entire death count caused by violence to civilians and battles. This could be attributed to President Duerte taking office in June 2016 and declaring a drug war. The violence to civilians could be collateral damage and battles could be with drug gangs resisting against the crackdown.\r\nThis could mean that the number of events and fatalities before 2016 could be even higher had data from Philippines been made available. Following the addition of Phillipines to the dataset, deaths due to violence towards civilians and battles from Phillipines remained the highest until 2019 where the conflict between the Rohingya muslims and the Myanmar government intensified in the Rakhine state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 48: Numerous deadly events in Rakhine in 2019\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Our application looks to guide the beginner investor in their journey to begin investing by zeroing in on a select few stocks, commodities and bonds.\r\n2.0 Motivation and Objectives\r\nExisting financial data websites such as Yahoo Finance do a good job in providing historical price data and technical indicators, but the beginner investor lacks the knowledge to properly utilise and benefit from these. For example, there is a whole plethora of technical indicators available for use, but whether the investor is able to truly understand and use them properly is questionable. We have also identified a gap in such websites, that they do not provide any form of forecasting or cross-asset analysis to aid in investors’ decisions. In addition, it may be informative for an investor to see how macro events on a global scale may affect assets.\r\nThis project aims to utilise various R packages, mainly tidyverse, TTR and dtwcluster in building an interactive R Shiny application. The R Shiny application (details in section 2) will be an integrated dashboard which allows users to perform different types of analysis while aiding them in making informed decisions in portfolio construction.\r\n3.0 Scope\r\nFinancial Asset Universe - The list of assets covered in our application is shown below:\r\nS/N\r\nStock Market Indices\r\nCommodities\r\nBonds\r\n1\r\nUS\r\nGold\r\nInvestment Grade\r\n2\r\nUK\r\nSilver\r\nHigh-Yield\r\n3\r\nGermany\r\nCopper\r\n\r\n4\r\nFrance\r\nIron\r\n\r\n5\r\nItaly\r\nNatural Gas\r\n\r\n6\r\nSpain\r\nCrude Oil\r\n\r\n7\r\nBrazil\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\nSingapore\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\nHong Kong\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\nJapan\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\nChina\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\nAustralia\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\nKorea\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\nIndia\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0 Data\r\nWe will extract all historical price data from Jan 1 1997 to Dec 31 2020 for our selected assets using Bloomberg Terminal. The fields which we will extract data for include:\r\nOpen Price: The asset’s opening price on a trading day\r\nHigh Price: The asset’s highest price on a trading day\r\nLow Price: The asset’s lowest price on a trading day\r\nClose Price: The asset’s closing price on a trading day\r\n5.0 Application Features\r\nThe main target audience for our application are prospective investors who are looking for a tool to help them build their portfolio and diversify their holdings. This section explores features of our application and some ways it can help our users. The application itself is split up into 3 main sections address different parts of the investing process.\r\n5.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\r\nBase visualizations and analysis of key financial asset returns metrics\r\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. It will be useful for potential investors to have a visual tool to understand various key metrics when analysing financial assets. Some of the key metrics our application aims to help users visualize include:\r\nCorrelation\r\nCorrelation matrix to show correlation between selected assets at different time horizons\r\n\r\nDistribution of returns\r\nHistogram showing distribution of returns for different assets will allow users to visualize volatility\r\n\r\nRisk to Reward\r\nPurely looking at gross returns often does not paint the full picture as most high-returns assets come with greater volatility. Metrics such as Sharpe - Ratio will allow users to get a better sense of the Risk:Reward profile of different assets\r\n\r\nTechnical indicators\r\nTechnical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.\r\nOur application will categorize indicators based on their category (trend, momentum or volatility) so as to allow users to know precisely what the indicator is looking at. This is in contrast to many existing websites where users have a whole plethora of indicators at their disposal but not knowing what they are actually evaluating.\r\n\r\nPossible insights: Diversification through identifying weakly correlated markets and indices. This allows the user to ‘put their eggs across different baskets’ and spread out their risk.\r\n5.2 Time-Series Forecasting\r\nPredicting financial asset prices using an ARIMA model\r\nARIMA is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It is a class of model that captures a suite of different standard temporal structures in time series data.\r\nAR: Autoregression. A regression model that uses the dependencies between an observation and a number of lagged observations.\r\nI: Integrated. To make the time series stationary by measuring the differences of observations at different time.\r\nMA: Moving Average. An approach that takes into accounts the dependency between observations and the residual error terms when a moving average model is used to the lagged observations (q).\r\nAlong with various parameters to be tuned, an ARIMA model uses purely price action data for forecasting future prices.\r\nThe general form of an ARIMA model is denoted as ARIMA (p, q, d). With seasonal time series data, it is likely that short-run non-seasonal components contribute to the model. ARIMA model is typically represented as ARIMA (p, q, d), where: —\r\np is the number of lag observations utilized in training the model (i.e., lag order).\r\nd is the number of times differencing is applied (i.e. the degree of differencing).\r\nq is known as the size of the moving average window (i.e., order of moving average).\r\nPossible insights: Forecast what are the likely price movements in the period ahead in order to identify optimal entry points\r\n5.3 Time-Series Clustering\r\nClustering financial assets based on historical returns\r\nTime series clustering is to partition time series data into groups based on similarity or distance, so that time series in the same cluster are similar. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is used as the similarity/distance metric and finds optimal alignment between two time series.\r\nThe first step is to work out an appropriate distance/similarity metric (i.e. DTW).\r\nThe second step, use existing clustering techniques, such as k-means, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering or subspace clustering, to find clustering structures.\r\nThe final result will then be presented on the visualization.\r\nPossible insights: Time series in the same cluster are likely to undergo similar cycles and risks.This means that users can expect similar movements across cycles/periods and act accordingly.\r\n6.0 Tools and Packages\r\nS/N\r\nPackage\r\nDocumentation\r\n1\r\ntidyverse\r\nhttps://www.tidyverse.org/\r\n2\r\ndplyr\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.7.8\r\n3\r\nTTR\r\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TTR/index.html\r\n4\r\nplotly\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plotly/versions/4.9.3/topics/plot_ly\r\n5\r\nggplot2\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggplot2/versions/3.3.3\r\n6\r\nShiny\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/shiny/versions/1.6.0\r\n7\r\ndtwcluster\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dtwclust/versions/3.1.1\r\n8\r\ndygraphs\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dygraphs/versions/1.1.1.6\r\n9\r\ntidyquant\r\nhttps://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyquant/index.html\r\n10\r\nreadr\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/readr/versions/1.3.1\r\n11\r\nrticles\r\nhttps://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rticles/versions/0.18\r\n7.0 References\r\nA benchmark study on time series clustering\r\nA Scalable Method for Time Series Clustering\r\nTechnical Analysis with R\r\nExamination of the profitability of technical analysis based on moving average strategies in BRICS\r\nStock Price Prediction Using the ARIMA Model\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This makes it hard for the users to compare the ratings across different categories and also makes it hard to tell whether the responses were skewed towards agreement or disagreement.\r\nRedo the diverging stacked bar chart with the neutral values of the likert scale centred around zero.\r\nC2\r\nThe categories in the current chart is ordered alphabetically. This is not meaningful as there is no analytical findings nor message conveyed through unordered categories such as country names.\r\nSort the categories (rows) of the table by the proportion of a chosen response type and synchronize the order across both visualizations. This is important in order to compare the visualization across both charts.\r\nC3\r\nInformation is missing on how many respondents are there per country. This can be very valuable in providing a context to readers.\r\nAdd in the count of respondents from each country as a tooltip.\r\nC4\r\nThe respondents of each country is made up from different social strata. Each group can have different attitudes towards vaccination. By grouping them all by country, we run the risk of over-generalization.\r\nAdd in options for users to filter and slice the visualizations. This allows the user to glean more insight. e.g. comparing the willingness of respondents aged over 65 and unemployed in two different countries.\r\nC5\r\nThe second chart on the right shows the proportion of strongly agree responses as a point estimate. That can be misleading as there is often uncertainty associated with such survey data.\r\nChange the chart to a point estimate with error bars showing the confidence interval of the responses.\r\nC6\r\nThe survey consists of a lot of questions and the current visualization only shows the responses relating to one question. This undermines the usefulness of the survey.\r\nAdd in options to view the responses of other questions in the survey.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\nS/N\r\nComments\r\nSuggested Improvements\r\nA1\r\nColours on the chart are randomised and do not follow a logical pattern.\r\nReplot the chart with colours on a red-blue spectrum. Red should be on one end of the spectrum to indicate ‘Strongly Disagree’ and Blue on the other end to indicate ‘Strongly Agree’\r\nA2\r\nScale of the diverging stacked bar chart starts at 0% and ends at 100%. This will not be sufficient to display the full range of responses gathered on vaccination opinions.\r\nAdjust scale of the bar and the values of the responses to allow for negative values. This will allow the negative opinions (4 and 5) that show disagreement to be accurately represented. It will also help to answer the question posed by the title:Which country is more pro-vaccine? i.e. Change from the responses from 1 to 5 to -2 to 2.\r\nA3\r\nLegend not properly named and labeled. While readers can infer the feedback when given by the two extreme values of ‘Strongly Agree’ and ‘Strongly Disagree’, it would be clearer to properly label each and every one of them.\r\nRename the legend and specifically label each and every one of the different colors on the diverging bar chart.\r\nA4\r\nClear titles on both charts\r\nFollow and recreate a similar aesthetic.\r\n2 - The suggested visualization\r\nThe proposed design is as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Sketching the Suggested Visualizations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 - The Visualization process\r\nThe Data Source used is from the Imperial College London YouGov Covid 19 Behaviour Tracker Data Hub.

When comparing this against the results of the question: “I am worried about the potential side effects of a Covid-19 vaccine.” The French respondents ranked top by proportion of ‘Strongly Agree’ responses.\r\nConversely, using the green boxes, we can see the countries of Netherlands and United Kingdom having correspondingly high levels of vaccine acceptance and low levels of worries about side-effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 54: Resistance to vaccine could come from fear\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.2 Bigger familes have mixed views on vaccines\r\nOn the same survey question: “If a Covid-19 Vaccine were made available to me this week, I would definitely get it.” You can see a huge standard error in the proportion of ‘Strongly Agree’ responses. This could be due to a couple of reasons. The first could be due to the actual divergence in views in large families. The second is could be due to a smaller sample size, which is the case. (Most of the survey respondents had family sizes of 1-3).\r\nA takeaway on this is to view the data as a whole without filtering on household size unless the number of survey responses from larger households can be collected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 55: Increased SE in bigger families\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3 Many are waiting before taking vaccine\r\nFollowing the same line of thought from the previous insight. Vaccine worries tend to ease off with time with better research and testing. The general attitude towards vaccine warms up considerably when vaccines were to be made available in one year instead of one week. This can be seen in lower number of disagreeing responses across the board (orange boxes) and higher number of strongly agree across all countries (green boxes).\r\nA takeaway for the authorities could be that while aggressively ramping up vaccination capacity, they need to work on converting opinions on vaccine safety as well. Ambitious targets to vaccinate whole populations in months could be futile if the population is resistant towards taking the vaccines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 56: Vaccine opinions improve over time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is unclear and does not inform the reader quickly what the visualization is depicting which is the comparison of labour force by age groups between 2009 and 2019.\r\nSuggestion - Change title\r\nUse the title “Resident Labour Force in Singapore by Age Groups, June of of 2009 & 2019”\r\n1.1.2 Wrong visualization used for the given datatype\r\nAge groups are a categorical datatype. The line graph being used currently is better suited for continuous datatypes.\r\nSuggestion - Change Visualization Type\r\nSwitch to using a bar graph instead of a line graph.\r\nEnsure Vertical Axis starts at zero\r\n1.1.3 Plotting a median line on categorical scale\r\nData has already been binned into age groups. There is no way of calculating a discrete median age like 41. If there is a median, it should be the age group of 40-44. i.e. Both groups will have the same median.\r\nSuggestion - Remove the median lines\r\nMark the bars for 40-44 with a label to show that the median falls within that category.\r\n1.1.4 Percentages can omit context\r\nUsing percentages like the Labour force participation rate can omit important contextual information like the true number of people in each age group.\r\nSuggestion - Plot the bar graph with actual numbers instead of percentages\r\nBar graphs should be sufficient to show the differences in proportions across different categories\r\n1.1.5 Unclear description of percentages points\r\nWhen comparing percentages across different groups and time periods, the term to be used should be percentage points. While the write up does not use the words percentage change, it can be ambiguous.\r\nSuggestion - Clarify the changes in percentages.\r\nPoints being made on changes in percentages such as “Declined from 75% to 67%” can be rewritten as “Declined 8 percentage points from 75% to 67%”.\r\n1.1.6 Write up not aligned with visualization\r\nThe opening line of the write up refers to LFPR (Labour Force Participation Rate) whereas the visualization depicts the proportion of labour force. There is no data visualization that readers can refer to while reading statements related to LFPR.The percentages for labour force between 25 and 54 are also not clearly shown.\r\nSuggestion - Include a more visualizations on Labour Force Participation and proportion of labour force.\r\nUse Table 5 on labour force and Table 7 on participation rates to get numbers by age group for labour force participation. Together, the graphs will give a clearer idea of how much labour force participation there is with respect to the resident labour force size. The added visuals will also give view on what is the proportion of resident labour force across age groups.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n1.2.1 Missing vertical axis and gridlines\r\nVertical axis is missing, and gridlines are not present on the vertical axis. This can make comparison across different age groups difficult. The units for the vertical axis “Per Cent” is put under the title as well.\r\nSuggestion - Add in missing elements\r\nVertical axis should be added to the visualization\r\nGridlines and tick marks on the vertical axis should be added\r\nLabel Vertical axis title as “Resident Labour Force (‘000s)”\r\n1.2.2 Good use of Colours\r\nGood consistent (e.g. lines, labels, data table) use of colours to differentiate between 2009 and 2019.\r\nSuggestion - Follow and recreate a similar aesthetic.\r\nEnsure colours and format are replicated across both graphs.\r\n1.2.3 Good use of space and colouring\r\nFollowing on from point S2, the colours have already well marked out the datapoints and features relating to 2009 and 2019. It would be superfluous to add in a legend.\r\nSuggestion - Follow and recreate a similar aesthetic.\r\nSwitching to a grouped bar chart would mean that colors will be important for readers to tell the different categories apart because we will not be able to label the lines the way the original visualization did. Ensure that a legend is included and consistent across both charts.\r\n1.2.4 Missing horizontal axis label\r\nHorizontal axis label is missing. Although it can be inferred based on the categories and the title of the visualization. It would be better if the axis is clearly labelled.\r\nSuggestion - Add in missing elements\r\nLabel horizontal axis title as “Age Groups”\r\nGridlines and tick marks will not be needed as visualization will be changed to a bar graph.\r\n2 - A sketch of the improved visualization\r\nWith reference to the critics above, suggest alternative graphical presentation to improve the current design. The proposed alternative data visualisation must be in static form. Sketch out the proposed design. Support your design by describing the advantages or which part of the issue(s) your alternative design tries to overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: A sketch of the suggested visualizatons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 - The improved data visualization\r\nMore Older Residents in the Workforce\r\nWith population ageing and sustained rise in LFPR of older residents, the share of residents aged 55 & over in the labour force rose 9 percentage points from 16% in 2009 to 25% in 2019. Meanwhile, the share of the resident labour force aged 24 to 54 declined 8 percentage points from 75% to 67% even as their LFPR increased, as the population cohorts moving into these age bands were smaller than those who moved out due to lower birth rates. While the median age of residents in the labour force stayed in the 40-44 year old age group from 2009 to 2019, it is likely that the median age will soon shift up to the 45-49 year old age group as the population ages further.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: The improved data visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe link to the original dashboard on Tableau Public Server can be found here.\r\n4 - The data preparation process\r\nProvide step-by-step description on how the data visualization was prepared.\r\n4.1 Data Sources Used:\r\nRESIDENT LABOUR FORCE AGED FIFTEEN YEARS AND OVER BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 - 2019 (JUNE) - Table 7\r\nRESIDENT LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 - 2019 (JUNE) - TABLE 5\r\n4.2 Steps taken for first Visualization\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Original (TOTAL) Dataset in table 7\r\nUsing the (TOTAL) sheet in table 7 (mrsd_2019LabourForce_T7.xlsx), select and preserve only the required data. i.e. Age groups, 2009 and 2019. Delete all other rows (including the total row) and columns (and blank columns).\r\nRename “Age (Years)” to “Age Groups”\r\nRemove whitespaces in data. e.g. “15 - 19” to “15-19” and “70 and over” to “>=70” to maximise use of space.\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Remaining Dataset after trimming\r\nSave the excel file,create a new Tableau workbook and load the file (mrsd_2019LabourForce_T7.xlsx) into Tableau.

These groups form the biggest part of the residential workforce and also participate the most. This is important for Singapore’s economy as its biggest group of workers are consistently and actively participating in positive economic activity. This is also something to be concerned about, as this group of workers age, their workforce participation is likely to mirror that of the current older age groups. If this group of residents (the largest group) turn older and stop partcipating, it will have grave consequences for Singapore’s economy and signals the need for rejuvenation.\r\n\r\nFigure 29: The biggest group of workers participate actively in the workforce\r\n5.2 Workforce participation changes significantly from 65\r\nThe workforce participants in each age group usually account for the majority of resident workforce (i.e. >50% as seen by the orange arrows). This is true until the age group of 65-69 (as marked out by the blue arrows). From here on, the work force participation drops significantly and goes below 50%. This is in line with what we can expect from Singapore’s offcial retirement age, currently set at 67 years old. With the retirement age expected to be raised till 70 years old in by 2030, the workforce participation picture is likely to change significantly from what we are seeing now.\r\n\r\nFigure 30: Workforce participation drops significantly after 65 years old.\r\n5.3 Insufficient young workers to replace old workers\r\nAs can be clearly seen, large numbers of the workforce are growing old and retiring from the workforce. This means that a younger generation has to take over. The numbers of younger workers (15-24 year olds) have been stagnating from 2009 to 2019. This is to be expected from the low birth rates seen in Singapore, which also explains the need for influx of foreign workers to supplant the requirements of the economy.\r\n\r\nFigure 31: Stagnating growth in young residential workforce and participation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
